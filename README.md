Being an avid sports buff, I will be working with data pertaining to the participants, events, winners, etc from the last 120 years of Olympics, obtained from SportsStats. Even though the dataset holds vast categories of data and can be of use to numerous people across different walks of life, I will be doing an analysis to obtain some trivia, insight into the winning trends and explain these with the data available.

## The Dataset

The dataset used for the analysis can be obtained [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0wqw8fmiwrzr8ef/AABQijjQM522INXX1FCdamzma?dl=0)
